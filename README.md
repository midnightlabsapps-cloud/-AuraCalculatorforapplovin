# Aura Calculator

A modern, customizable, and multifunctional calculator for Android, built with React Native.

## 📌 About This Project

Aura Calculator is an independent (indie) project currently in active development. The goal is to create a calculator that is not only powerful but also beautiful and a delight to use.

This is a serious project that aims to combine utility with a top-tier UI design. We are currently in the process of integrating monetization services and preparing the app for its official launch.

## ✨ Key Features

Based on v1.8 screenshots, these are the currently implemented features:

* **"Aura" Theme Engine:** The app's core feature.

  * Allows the user to choose from over 10 vibrant and unique themes to customize their experience (e.g., Midnight, Deep Blue, Aurora Borealis, Matrix, Sakura Dreams, etc.).

* **Dual Calculator (Standard & Scientific):**

  * **Standard Mode:** For all day-to-day arithmetic operations.

  * **Scientific Mode:** Includes trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithms (`ln`, `log`), constants (`π`, `e`), power (`x^y`), and square root (`√`).

* **Integrated Utility Tools:**

  * **Currency Converter:** A clean utility to convert between currencies (e.g., USD to EUR) with real-time exchange rates.

  * **Bill Splitter:** A dedicated tool to easily split a total bill among several people, including tip calculation (with predefined or custom percentages).

* **Advanced History:**

  * Saves a log of recent calculations.

  * Allows searching the history.

  * Allows filtering by type (All, Calculations, Conversions).

* **App Management:**

  * Full side menu with access to Settings, Widgets, Feedback, and community links (Discord).

  * Support for Premium modes (to unlock features or themes).

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Framework:** React Native (Expo)

* **Navigation:** Expo Router

* **Animations:** `react-native-reanimated`

* **Gestures:** `react-native-gesture-handler`
